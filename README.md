# E-commerce
Lab assignment for course D0018E

The assignement of this lab was to create a E-commerce site that would have the most essential features such as user/admin accounts, product pages, product cart, reviews, etc..

The lab was done in heavy collaboration with Simon Berghem (Github: https://github.com/SimonBerghem) and I DO NOT claim full credit for the work on this project.
